# File Descriptions

## 1. `fileGenerator.py`

### Purpose
This Python script is designed to scrape text content from web pages and generate text files from that content. It uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML content and extracts text from specific HTML elements.

### Key Features
- Scrapes web pages based on URLs provided in an Excel file.
- Handles cases where specific HTML elements and classes are used to identify the content to be scraped.
- Writes the scraped content into text files with names corresponding to the URLs.

### Usage
- Provide a list of URLs and their corresponding identifiers in an Excel file (`Input.xlsx`).
- Run the script to scrape content from the URLs and generate text files in the `textfiles` directory.

## 2. `failed_urls.py`

### Purpose
This Python script is used to handle cases where scraping content from web pages using specific class identifiers fails. It manually specifies class identifiers for certain URLs and generates text files from those pages.

### Key Features
- Manually specifies class identifiers for specific URLs.
- Uses BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content and extracting text.
- Generates text files with names corresponding to the URLs.

### Usage
- Manually specify class identifiers for URLs in the script.
- Run the script to generate text files for the specified URLs in the `textfiles` directory.

## 3. `sentiment.py`

### Purpose
This Python script analyzes the sentiment and linguistic features of text files generated from web pages. It uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to perform sentiment analysis and calculate various linguistic metrics.

### Key Features
- Analyzes sentiment using the VADER sentiment analysis tool.
- Calculates positive and negative scores, polarity score, subjectivity score, average sentence length, complex word count, and more.
- Generates syllable counts per word and identifies personal pronouns.

### Usage
- Create an instance of the `WordAnalyser` class for each text file.
- Use the class methods to perform sentiment analysis and linguistic analysis on the text content.

## 4. `output.py`

### Purpose
This Python script combines the results of sentiment analysis and linguistic analysis performed on multiple text files and stores the data in a CSV file.

### Key Features
- Reads input data from an Excel file (`Input.xlsx`) and a set of text files generated by the `fileGenerator.py` script.
- Utilizes the `WordAnalyser` class from `sentiment.py` to analyze each text file.
- Computes various sentiment and linguistic metrics for each file and stores them in a CSV file (`output.csv`).
